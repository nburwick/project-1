## Project Description

We are a brewery, Code Brews, looking to expand to a new location. Our goal is to determine potentially successful business locations based on 
- Selling price of imported and domestic beer 
- Monthly expenses
- Number of customers 
- Transportation costs  
- Production costs
- Location

We will use data sets with various cost of living data for cities and countries across the world, but focus our search on US cities only.  We will build visualizations to attempt to relate various costs of goods and services to cities and city attributes.  We will combine data sets to find insights for the perfect market area that might not be apparent to our other competitors.  

## Research Questions
1. What correlations can we see in transportation cost and price of beer? 
    - Is there a correlation to average income and pricing in an given area?
    - Include domestic and imported beer findings
<br>
<br>
2. How does household type vs. location affect our target market?
    - Can these factors increase or decrease our product value?
<br>
<br>
3. On average, do people tend to spend more than they have? (Is this a good or bad thing for us? Drink to forget your sorrows.)

4. Can we estimate our beer production costs relative to each state from the available data (i.e. water cost and electricity/utility cost)?  And how does that impact our headquarters selection?
