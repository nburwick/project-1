# Code Brews
## Project Description
We are a brewery, Code Brews, looking to expand to a new location. Our goal is to determine potentially successful business locations based on 
Selling price of imported and domestic beer 
Monthly expenses
Number of customers 
Transportation costs  
Production costs
Location

We will use data sets with various cost of living data for cities and countries across the world, but focus our search on US cities only.  We will build visualizations to attempt to relate various costs of goods and services to cities and city attributes.  We will combine data sets to find insights for the perfect market area that might not be apparent to our other competitors.
